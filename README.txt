RANDOMIZER2077 - 1.1.1

Note: This was my very first time making a mod and writing in Lua, so uhh, the code isn't very pretty to look at. But hey, it works!

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Cyber Engine Tweaks
• Native Settings UI

:: FEATURES ::
• NPC Randomizer
• Loot/Vendor Randomizer
• Starting Inventory Randomizer
• Player Vehicle Randomizer
• Weapon Stats Randomizer
• Ads Randomizer
• Main Character Shuffle
• Main Bosses Shuffle
• Cyberpsycho Shuffle
• Turn Chosen % Of Enemies Into Cyberpsychos
• Full Main Character Shuffle
• Cursed Randomizer

:: KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Using the base NPC Randomizer: Enemy NPCs will occasionally randomize into NPCs that cannot be harmed via physical damage - only quickhacks - if it's an issue, regenerate the seed.
• Using the Starting Inventory Randomizer: If you re-launch the game and reload a save that's still in the mission 'The Rescue', you will be granted additional randomized items - not much I can do about that one though. :') Turning off the option once it's no longer useful is better anyway!
• Using the Player Vehicle Randomizer: Player cars will occasionally randomize into invalid and/or giant vehicles that will crash the game upon attempting to spawn them. Either regenerate the seed or do not call the vehicle.
• Using "Turn Chosen % Of Enemies Into Cyberpsychos": This option will only work well in tandem with the NPC Randomizer if both are turned on when the game is launched.
