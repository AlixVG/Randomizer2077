RANDOMIZER2077 - 1.2.0

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Cyber Engine Tweaks
• Native Settings UI

:: FEATURES ::
• NPC Randomizer
• Reflection Randomizer
• Loot/Vendor Randomizer
• Starting Inventory Randomizer
• Player Vehicle Randomizer
• Weapon Stats Randomizer
• Ads Randomizer
• Main Character Shuffle
• Main Bosses Shuffle
• Cyberpsycho Shuffle
• Turn Chosen % Of Enemies Into Cyberpsychos
• Full Main Character Shuffle
• Cursed Randomizer

• Character Swapper (by Jaxstutz)

:: KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Using the base NPC Randomizer: Enemy NPCs will occasionally randomize into NPCs that cannot be harmed via physical damage - only quickhacks - if it's an issue, regenerate the seed or use the new Character Swapper to change the problematic NPC to the original NPC (requires reloading the save).
• Using the Weapons Stats Randomizer: Throwing Knives will sometimes act like Swords/Katanas and won't be able to be thrown.
• Using the Player Vehicle Randomizer: Player cars will occasionally randomize into invalid and/or giant vehicles that will crash the game upon attempting to spawn them. Either regenerate the seed or do not call the vehicle.
• Using "Turn Chosen % Of Enemies Into Cyberpsychos": This option will only work well in tandem with the NPC Randomizer if both are turned on when the game is launched.
